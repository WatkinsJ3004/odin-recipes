            <li>1 red pepper</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
            <li>2 tbsp chilli powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp ground cumin</li>
            <li>500g Minced beef</li>
            <li>1 can chopped tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 can red kidney beans</li>
            <li>1 tbsp tomato puree</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare your vegetables. Chop 1 large onion into small dice, about 5mm square</li>
            <li>Cut 1 red pepper in half lengthways, remove stalk and wash the seeds away, then chop. Peel and finely chop 2 garlic cloves.</li>
            <li>Start cooking. Put your pan on the hob over a medium heat. Add 1 tbsp oil and leave it for 1-2 minutes until hot</li>
            <li>Add the onion and cook, stirring fairly frequently, for about 5 minutes, or until the onion is soft, squidgy and slightly translucent.</li>
            <li>Add in seasonings and cook for further 5 mins, stirring occasionally</li>
            <li>Brown 500g lean minced beef. Turn the heat up a bit, add the meat to the pan and break it up with your spoon or spatula. The mix should sizzle a bit when you add the mince.</li>
            <li>Add a 400g can of chopped tomatoes. Squirt in about 2 tbsp tomato pur√©e and stir the sauce well.</li>
            <li>Drain and rinse a 410g can of red kidney beans in a sieve and stir them into the chilli pot. Bring to the boil again, and gently bubble without the lid for another 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Now replace the lid, turn off the heat and leave your chilli to stand for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
            <li>Serve with boiled rice</li>
        </ol>
